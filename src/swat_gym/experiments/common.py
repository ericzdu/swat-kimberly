"""Experiment machinery shared by the drivers: parallel CMA-ES and reusable stage files.

A stage (one ES seed, one CMA-ES search, a reference run, ...) is saved as
``{"config": ..., "result": ...}`` and reused only while its config matches exactly, so a
changed model, price, setting or code version recomputes it instead of mixing results.
